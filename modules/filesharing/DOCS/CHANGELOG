		In relation with BUG 921916 I have changed the way file icons are displayed
                now Owl extracts the extension of the files, and if the ext.gif exists in the icon_filetype
                directory then it is displayed if not a generic one is shown.  This will allow anyone that has
                specific icon need to just ad the icons they want to the directory. COOL huh?
