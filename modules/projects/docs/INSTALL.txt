Flyspray -  A ten step getting-started guide.

Step One:  Unpack the compressed package into a directory where your web
server can reach it.  It will extract into its own flyspray-version/ directory.
If you're reading this, you've probably already done that.

Step Two:  Create a mysql database for Flyspray to use.  Here is one way to do
that, from the unix/linux command line, entering your mysql root password when
prompted:

mysqladmin -u root -p create flyspray

If you prefer PostgreSQL, create flyspray database user:

createuser -ADP flyspray

and then a database itself:

createdb -E UNICODE -O flyspray flyspray

Step Three:  Make flyspray.conf.php writeable by the webserver.

Step Four:  If you need the setup program to install ADOdb for you, make the
adodb/ directory writeable by the webserver.

Step Five:  Point your browser to http://yourserver/flyspray-version/ and
follow along with the setup script.

Step Six: Click the Projects link to set up your project options, user groups
and lists.

Step Seven:  If you wish to be able to upload attachments, you will need to make
the attachments/ directory writeable by the webserver process.  The easiest way
to do this is to make it world writeable.  In unix/linux this is done like this:

chmod a+rwx attachments

Note that this could be a security issue.  You really should learn to make it
only writable by the process running your webserver.

Step Eight: Close the sample task, and begin adding your own.

Step Nine:  To report any bugs in Flyspray or request developer support, see
the 'Support' link on the Flyspray website - http://flyspray.rocks.cc/?p=Support

Step Ten:  Flyspray 0.9.8 is so easy to set up, there is no step ten.  Enjoy!
