         Flyspray Quality Assurance
         ==========================

This file contains a list of things to check before release and after major
changes in code.

Please note that some tests may require having two users--more and less
privileged--and two web browsers. These tests are marked with [2U].

Some tests are meant to fail; these are marked with [F].

Installation:
* correctly detect or install ADOdb
* detect if flyspray.conf.php is writeable
* licence agreement displays correctly, and will not advance without acceptance
* insert database tables using specified dbprefix
* enable/disable address_rewriting based upon apache mod_rewrite availability
* enable/disable reminder_daemon based upon cli php availability
* set admin details
* logs-in admin after install has finished

Upgrade:
* correctly detect or install ADOdb
* detect if flyspray.conf.php is writeable
* licence agreement displays correctly, and will not advance without acceptance
* insert database upgrade tables

Be sure to test everything below with address_rewriting both ON and OFF.

Tasks:
* create task
* create task twice in a row with the same details [F]
* find task using 'Show Task' box
* show task details
* show task details for non-existent task [F]
* take ownership (when permissions allow)
* take ownership (when permissions don't allow)
* add comment without attachment
* add comment with attachment
* check history entries
* assign task
* close task
* add dependency
* add dependency on non-existent task
* search for tasks (check all conditions--developers, categories,
  severities, etc.--separately)
