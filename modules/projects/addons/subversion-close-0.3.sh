# subversion-close.sh is called by a post-commit hook in Subversion, which passes it the repo name
# and revision number of the commit. This is typically achieved using an entry like this:
#
#    /usr/share/flyspray/hooks/subversion-close.sh "$REPOS" "$REV"
#
# in 'hooks/post-commit' inside your SVN repository. Once called, subversion-close.sh uses the svnlook
# tool to examine the changelog entry for the revision number it was given. If it finds any lines in
# the changelog of the form:
#
#    closes: #123
#
# it extracts the number from the line and determines which user committed the change. It supports
# multiple bug closures per commit, is case-insensitive, and doesn't care about whitespace around
# the entry (although the single space inside does matter). So it would be ugly but valid to put
# this in a single changelog:
#
#  Closes: #23
#    clOsEs: #24
#   CLOSES: #25
#
# It then attempts to find a file containing the password of that user in its subversion-close
# config directory, named in the form:
#
#    /etc/flyspray/subversion-close/pass-<username>.txt
#
# and containing a plain-text password for that user. For example, if the commit was done by the
# user 'jon' it will look for '/etc/flyspray/subversion-close/pass-jon.txt'. If it does not find a
# password file for the nominated user it falls back to searching for a password file named:
#
#    /etc/flyspray/subversion-close/pass-svn.txt
#
# and continues as if the user that committed the change was 'svn'. It is therefore necessary to
# create a user in Flyspray called 'svn' with sufficient privileges to close tasks, and store the
# password for that user in '/etc/flyspray/subversion-close/pass-svn.txt'. You should also create
# password files for the users who will commonly commit fixes so the notifications and messages in
# Flyspray appear to have been made by the correct user.
#
# It then builds an entry to be used as the 'closure reason' in Flyspray, essentially just the SVN
# changelog with a bit of tweaking.
#
# Finally it uses an XML-RPC library to build a connection to the Flyspray server and close the
# task, submitting the various bits of information such as the changelog entry along with it.
#
# Installation:
#  - mkdir /usr/share/flyspray/hooks and copy this script into it.
#  - mkdir /etc/flyspray/subversion-close and put some pass-<user>.txt files there.
#  - put a call to this script in your repository post-commit hook (repopath/hooks/post-commit)
#     like this: '/usr/share/flyspray/hooks/subversion-close.sh "$REPOS" "$REV"'
#  - put a .htaccess file in /usr/share/flyspray/hooks/ with 'deny from all' in it and make sure
#     Apache honours it.
#
# Security issues:
# Note that the last item is very important! You don't want people to call this script
# directly, so make sure your .htaccess denies everything to the hooks directory.
