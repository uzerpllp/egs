# Enterprise Groupware System (EGS)

This repository contains the original EGS source code. It was converted from the Sourceforge CVS repository and is presented here for historical purposes.

EGS is no longer maintained. If you are looking for software to help you run and manage your business, please have a look at [uzERP](https://uzerp.com).

EGS was developed by Senokian Solutions Ltd. Control of the project was passed to Severn Delta in 2009 and then developed into uzERP. uzERP continues to be developed under uzERP LLP from 2010.

# From the original EGS website

EGS is an Open Source business system released under the GNU GPL that is sponsored and supported by an established commercial company - Senokian Solutions.

Unlike other similar applications, EGS is not beholden to share holders or venture capitalists, and is developed by a team of keen Open Source programmers, with the support and sponsorship of Senokian Solutions.

As a best of breed solution this means you can take advantage of all the benefits of Open Source Software development whilst having the peace of mind that the software you are running your business on is produced and supported by a commercial company committed to the ideals of Open Source Software. At present EGS uses some or all of the components from the following projects:

- adodb
- Smarty
- Prototype
- Scriptaculous
- Zend Framework

EGS would like to thank the developers of the above projects for their excellent software and for releasing them under an Open Source License.
